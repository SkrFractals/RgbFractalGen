tree broken cutfunctions
tricomb broken cutfunctions

-fix gif encoder restart (right now I have made it QueueReset which is ok)

convert to mp4 doesn't yet work

Tests:
/ saving non exported png animation crashes on threading
/ test toggling png and gif
T test PNGS export to PNGS and MP4 with and without gif
/ test GIF export with and without png/gif
T test GIF->MP4 export with, without GIF

Restart batch (don't go to the next)

Batching:
-Batch Finished message
-Run Batch - switch on export, error message in generation and export doesn't match
-selectBatch - actually select it, to zero when loading one
-update batch - button and implementation (how even?)

-Add batches and generate options to tooltips

Preview has messes up zoom and rotation...?

/antispin2 (non center flips too) - so that the smaller centers in periphery don't all rotate in the same direction

still blinking grey...?
editor - draw arrows?

Cs:
-fs?Close() in Abort cannot access file?

CLR:
-abort freeze on bitmap64
-return FINISHTASK
-add the rest of definitions
-hide Task_X(???)
-CPP
-Encoder stride
-float->double
-zoomchild
-editor all angles/colors
-new palettes
-turn the edit color to a short box
-Colors[selectPaletteType] - copy into applyPalette so deleting a palette doens't crash
-- also copy angle (with maxchildren control)
